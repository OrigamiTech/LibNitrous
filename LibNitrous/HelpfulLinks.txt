File format information:

		Information is wrong for NCGR data:
			RAHC 'Header Size' doesn't exist,
			RAHC 'Tile Count' is Tile Count Y,
			RAHC 'Tile Size' is Tile Count X,
			Tile Size seems to always be 8 pixels square.
			SOPC 'Tile Size?' might be bytes-per-tile. In this case the above line may be incorrect.
